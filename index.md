**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

For me personally, the most interesting topic we covered in my domain knowledge was just learning about the different factuality factors. There are multiple important factors that need to be considered when checking the intentions and authenticity of a news article. Learning how about how different factors need to be evaluated was very interesting.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

I definitely want to explore some of the other factuality factors that I chose a bit more. So far I was primarily focused on looking into how I can use sentiment analysis for classifying new articles. While I did have a lot of success with this, in order to reach the next level of accuracy and precision, I need to start looking at my other factuality factors. The two primary ones that I would like to add are looking into clickbait and toxicity. While it may be a bit difficult to measure these parameters, I beleive that with enough manipulation and with the help of LLMs, these two factuality factors will be very useful for my goals.

**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

In quarter 1, most of the work was done indivisually, and we would simply share out findings with one and another. While there were a few instances where we shared datasets with one and another, overall there wasn't very much collaboration. However I think this is something that everyone including the mentor wants to change going forwards. I want to start working as a team more so that we can hold each other accountable and help each reach greater results.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

Something that we haven't been able to do is use public LLM APIs to make calls to these language models with the intention of using them to engineer our features. The issue so far has been that these APIs cost money to use. Dr.Arsanjani did request student credits for us from Google, but we only received one code. He is planning on reaching out to get more codes, so hopefully next quarter will have access to Google credits that can be put towards API costs.
